For now, im just writing some random stuff in here, thinking about my relationship with wenyue, i mean she is a good girl, im not complaining about anything, its just im feeling something really weird right now, i cant tell are we really in love or not, we dont have any intemesty or any other interaction  besides having dinner together, and latey, that only interaction is gone for good, i might be my fault that i couldnt stand for spoiler but I never say anything about not watching it anymore, wenyue just simpley overreacting everything, keep being weird and so rejective, Me being her boyfriend for almost a year, and yet i cant even sit on her bed. what kind of relationship is that? being together for a year and we have never had any sex, not even hug or cuddle. Am i doing it wrong? or she is doing it wrong. I just dont know how can you having a relationship without even hanging out, this is absolutly wrong, especially when she decide to not having dinner with me anymore. I mean i am totally ok with eating on my own,but cant she at least invite me or as me do i want to have dinner together, I really couldnt understand,why would she just go out buy dinner and eat on her own. I dont want to break up with her, becasue i think she is a good girl a keeper, and we might atually have a future together, but if she keeping pushing me away then i dont know what is the point of everthing, what i need is not having someone eating with me, I just want to have someone with me, we dont even need to talk, just be with a same room, and let me know that i am not alone. I dont think i can do this anymore, because this is not a relationship at all! Plus i dont have find she that attractive anymore, because we dont have much in common, personality, hobbie, what we do for fun, hangout on weekend, travel, what to buy, and most of all -cat. plus she being so lazy is not attactive at all.
